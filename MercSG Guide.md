### 2.How to level up fast?
**--> Sub-quest Scrolls, Hot Time & Efficient Field Hunting!!!**  
#### 2.1 Sub-quest Scroll  
Sub-quest scroll looks like this:  
![Sub-quest Scroll](https://github.com/LeviShaSha/Lineage2-Revolution/blob/master/Materials/sub-quest%20scroll.JPG "Sub-quest Scroll")  
  
By compeleting sub-quests, you can gain plenty of Exp & Adena:
![Sub-quest Scroll](https://github.com/LeviShaSha/Lineage2-Revolution/blob/master/Materials/Sub-quest%20scroll%20Rewards.png "Sub-quest Scroll") 
  
We can do Sub-quest 5 times using Sub-quest scrolls per day. However, 3 times of resetting is allowed with cost of 50 red diamonds each, which means we can do 15 more Sub-quest today. THIS IS HELL LOT OF EXP & ADENA!!!
  
**Note: Please try to use all A level scrolls.**
  
##### 2.1.1 How can i get Sub-quest Scrolls?
Field Hunting(Main Source), Main-quest completion Rewards(Very Few) & Common Shop.

##### 2.1.2 What if i cannot get 20 A level scrolls each day by field hunting?
In this case, i suggest you to buy from common shop if you are rushing levels. Though it will cost you some adena but you can get most of the adena back after finishing the quest. Again, the exp matters!

  
#### 2.2 Hot Time
During Hot Time period(30 mins), you can enjoy 800% exp increase rate and 400% item drop rate in Elite Dungeon. The key to fully utilize the Hot Time is to farm the monsters near your level (+-4 lvls best). Based on my experience, during 30 mins hot time, u can gain 200+ items and tons of exp.

##### 2.2.1 Does the double exp potion stack with Hot Time?
I can assure you - "NO. CANNOT STACK". +图片
  
##### 2.2.2 Should i party up for Hot Time?
Depends.  
-If you have enough damage, please solo farm in Hot Time to maximize your acquisition of exp & items. Try pull 3-4 monsters together, use soulshots.  
  
-If you are tank/heal and dont have enough damage, try party up with 1-2 to farm monsters. 5 man party is not always the best option - teamates will share your Hot Time exp and item drop lol.  
  
#### 2.3 Efficient Field Hunting/Farming**
Field hunting/farming is the most important way of getting resource in this game. I spent 10+ hrs on afk field farming per day, which potentially can give me sub-quest scrolls, codex, few adena, runes, upgrade stones, enhancement scrolls, Maphr's protection and so on. Among these stuffs, the main purpose of field farming is to get enough **sub-quest scrolls & codex**.  
##### 2.3.1 How should i choose the spot for afk field farming?    
Step 1, find a monster near your level to farm.    
Step 2, move to the spot of monsters & find a place got few ppl and surrounded by target monsters.    
Step 3, start auto mode to test for a few minutes - to check whether you will die/whether you farm too slowly(Monster-clearance speed << Monster-revive speed)   
Step 4, adjust your spot/party up/change to another monster spot/... according to your test result in step 3.   
   
##### 2.3.2 Should i party up for field hunting?  
Similary to Hot time farming, please refer to 2.2.2 .  
  
##### 2.3.3 I found that overnight field farming waste many red/blue potions. Worth or not?  
Definitely worth it. There are some ways to reduce the cost.  
  
If you are DPS, try change sub-attribute of weapon/necklace/.. to get HP-Drain.  
If you are Mage, try to get MP Reg attribute.  
If you are Tank, ...party up maybe...  
  
### 3.How to farm more adena?
**--> Sub-quest Scrolls & Sell Unnecessary Items**  

#### 2.1 Sub-quest Scrolls  
Please refer to 2.1  

#### 2.2 Sell Unnecessary Items  
Believe me..You really don't have to use every C equipment for Level Up...Do remember to clear your bag in the morning/at noon so that you can keep getting new items during day-time field famring.     
  
### 4.How to get various enhancement materials?  
**--> Efficient Field Hunting & Trading**    

### 5.How to use red diamonds?
Below are few High CP ways of using red diamonds:   
**5.1 Reset Sub-quest**  
**5.1 Extend Hot Time**  
**5.2 Change Sub-Attributes of Equipments**
