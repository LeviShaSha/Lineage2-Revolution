## Part 1 Basic Guides
### 1.Basic Ideas(Non-Sense)
-Lineage2 Revolution is a typical Money-Or-Time game.(T_T).  
-Rushing for level is vital in this game.  
-Adena is the most important resource in this game.  
-The keys to enjoy this game are:  
 1) ~~Good luck!!!~~ Exquisite resource acquisition  
 2) ~~Good luck!!!~~ Reasonable resrouce arrangements  
 3) Good luck!!!  



### 2.How to level up fast?
**--> Sub-quest Scrolls, Hot Time & Efficient Field Hunting!!!**  
#### 2.1 Sub-quest Scroll  
Sub-quest scroll looks like this:  
![Sub-quest Scroll](https://github.com/LeviShaSha/Lineage2-Revolution/blob/master/Materials/sub-quest%20scroll.JPG "Sub-quest Scroll")  
  
By compeleting sub-quests, you can gain plenty of Exp & Adena.
  
We can do Sub-quest 5 times using Sub-quest scrolls per day. However, 3 times of resetting is allowed with cost of 50 red diamonds each, which means we can do 15 more Sub-quest per day. THIS IS HELL LOT OF EXP & ADENA!!!
  
**Note: Please try to use all A level scrolls.**
  
##### 2.1.1 How can i get Sub-quest Scrolls?
Field Hunting(Main Source), Main-quest completion Rewards(Very Few) & Common Shop.

##### 2.1.2 What if i cannot get 20 A level scrolls each day by field hunting?
In this case, i suggest you to buy from common shop if you are rushing for levels. Though it will cost you some adena but you can get most of the adena back after finishing the quest. Again, the exp matters!

  
#### 2.2 Hot Time
During Hot Time period(30 mins), you can enjoy 800% exp increase rate and 400% item drop rate in Elite Dungeon. The key to fully utilize the Hot Time is to farm the monsters near your level (+-4 lvls best). Based on my experience, during 30 mins hot time, u can gain 200+ items and tons of exp.

##### 2.2.1 Does the double exp potion stack with Hot Time?
I can assure you - "NO. CANNOT STACK".  
![Sub-quest Scroll](https://github.com/LeviShaSha/Lineage2-Revolution/blob/master/Materials/Tears.jpg "Sub-quest Scroll") 
  
##### 2.2.2 Should i party up for Hot Time?
Depends.  
-If you have enough damage, please solo farm in Hot Time to maximize your acquisition of exp & items. Try pull 3-4 monsters together, use soulshots.  
  
-If you are tank/healer and dont have enough damage, try party up with 1-2 to farm monsters. 5 man party is not always the best option - teamates will share your Hot Time exp and item drop lol.  
  
#### 2.3 Efficient Field Hunting/Farming  
Field hunting/farming is the most important way of getting resource in this game. I spent 10+ hrs on afk field farming per day, which potentially can give me sub-quest scrolls, codex, few adena, runes, upgrade stones, enhancement scrolls, Maphr's protection and so on. Among these stuffs, the main purpose of field farming is to get enough **sub-quest scrolls & codex**.  
  
##### 2.3.1 How should i choose the spot for afk field farming?    
Step 1, find a monster near your level to farm.    
Step 2, move to the spot of monsters & find a place got few ppl and surrounded by target monsters.    
Step 3, start auto mode to test for a few minutes - to check whether you will die/whether you farm too slowly(Monster-clearance speed << Monster-revive speed) or the other way round/....   
Step 4, adjust your spot/party up/change to another monster spot/... according to your test result in step 3.   
   
##### 2.3.2 Should i party up for field hunting?  
Similary to Hot time farming, if your have enough damage, just solo farm. If damage not enough, then party up. Do remember your party members will share the drop items.
  
##### 2.3.3 I found that overnight field farming waste many HP/MP potions. Worth or not?  
Definitely worth it. There are some ways to reduce the cost of HP/MP potions.  
  
If you are DPS, try change sub-stats of weapon/necklace/.. to get HP-Drain so as to save HP potions.  
If you are Mage, try to get MP Reg sub-stats & soul stone sub-attribute so as to save MP potions.  
If you are Tank, ...party up maybe...the damage may not be enough even you can tank.  

However, do have a long-term view and don't anyhow change the sub-stats just for cost-saving because it is really expensvie....
  
   
   
### 3.How to farm more adena?
**--> Sub-quest Scrolls & Sell Unnecessary Items**  

#### 2.1 Sub-quest Scrolls  
Please refer to 2.1  

#### 2.2 Sell Unnecessary Items  
Believe me..You really don't have to use every C equipment for Level Up...Do remember to clear your bag in the morning/at noon so that you can keep getting new items during day-time field famring.     
  
  
  
### 4.How to get various enhancement materials?  
**--> Efficient Field Farming & Trading**    
  
#### 4.1 Efficient Field Farming   
Please refer to 2.3  
  
#### 4.2 Trading  
Please refer to Advance Guides point 1



### 5.How to use red diamonds?
Below are some ways of using red diamonds with highest CP:   
#### 5.1 Reset Sub-quest    
Again, Sub-quest scrolls are the key to gain exp & adena.

#### 5.1 Extend Hot Time    
Compare to reset exp dungeon, I suggest you all to consider extent hot time to get tons of exp & items. Do note that during Hot Time, you can get really good staffs like tradeable S soul stones, tradeable A equipments, which could be selled at a great price in trading system. Also you can get black soul stone in elite dungeon.

#### 5.2 Change Sub-stats of Equipments  
In the late game, you will need to change sub-stats of your equipments. Each change requires 25/50/100 red diamonds for S/R/SR equipments. So you may want to save up some red diamonds beforehand. 

**Note: If you bought some packages with $$ and have extra red diamonds - In early stage of the game, you may consider to draw the 1200 equip package to fast get S/R items. While in later stage of the game, you may consider to draw the 1200 material package to fast get S/R soul stones/blessed scrolls and so on.**  


## Part 2 Advanced Guides  
### 1.How to use trade system?  
Trading system is a platform for us to sell tradeable items (with blue diamonds mark). There will be min & max price limit when you sell items. And 10% fee will be taken by system when you successfully sell your item and collect payment.

I myself do trading everyday and below are some screenshots of my trading rank & successful trades. In my opinion, trading system is really the place to make fortune.

#### 1.1 How can i earn blue diamonds to start my business?     
As mentioned before, you can get quite some tradeable materials from field farming, such as upgrade stone, enhancement scrolls, maphr's protection and so on. Meanwhile, you can get tradeable Soul Stones from Elite Dungeon. Therefore, you can simply try sell these items to get your very first fortune. Then you can start your business:D  
   
#### 1.2 What items are hot on market so i know what to sell?  
Depends on the server, timing & game update. For example: (not limited to)
--Some server more rich players, some servers less...(I guess new server less)
--During first half of month, you may sell R&SR normal items;but after 1 months, no one buys.

**You have to constantly checking the market and figure out which one is hot.**

For my server - gludios 2, Armor Upgrade Stone is kind of hot right now. I can always sell at around 90. It has been one month since the server opened, and it is now the timing for players to upgrade normal items to SR & combine massively for rare items then upgrade. Since we have only 1 weapon but 4 armors, we all lack armor upgrade stones. Thus, i foresee the armor upgrade stone to be hot for next 1 or 2 months.

However, there are some items are always hot - Rare equipments & Blessed scrolls.

#### 1.3 Apart sell my own stuffs, is it possible to buy in items and resale to earn blue diamonds? (even with 10% fee)  
Yes, Of course. Here are some examples from my trading history.
+图片图片

To do this kind of resale business, you must take note of some points:  
1) You must be aware of the current price situation for the item. Buy in with low price and sell out with higher price (must be acceptable by market). Make sure your profit can cover the 10% fee.  
  
2) Where there is money to earn, there is risk. Market can change at any time, so make sure you can take the risk, which means you still have some blue diamonds to keep the business going on even if you fail to resell the item you buy in. If you don't really have a fortune to spare, please try this only on cheap items like the armor upgrade stone i tried before.

Actually besides this resale business, I also sense some opportunity in process-then-sell business. For example, buy in S grade black/white soul stone, upgrade to R or SR and sell at a much higher price. Rich player always want finished product(*_*), so why dont we do the processing for them and charge! However, due to resource limitation & high risk, i haven't try this method...

#### 1.5 What price should i set for my items to sell?
Depends on the current market situation lol..

-For common items(those on sale every day), you have to check the current market price and set the price. Normally i set at the minimun price available (exclude outliars) in the market. E.g., Weapon enhancement scrolls, Accessory stones and so on.

-For rare items, you can just set the max price. If you cannot sell at max price then gradually adjust down bit by bit lol. Be patient and sell with a good price. E.g., Rare weapon/armor, Blessed scrolls and so on.
  
#### 1.6 What is the key to success in trading?
**1) Efficient Item/Material Farming **    
This is the base for your trading. Actually it's the base of the game lol. If you don't bother to do resale business then this is the only source of your blue diamonds. 
    
**2) Consistent Monitoring of Market Price & Patience**  
Em...Just keep checking the market when you auto doing quest, buy in with super low price and sell at a high price. You may need to wait a few days before the market trend change to your favor. So just be patient. Anyway, you can use the item if you really cannot gain profit from it...
